### **Task: Implement a Function to Send 0.1 ETH Using Web3.js**

**Q:**  
Write a Web3.js function that allows a user to send **0.1 ETH** from their Ethereum account to a specified recipient address. The function should handle the following:

- Request the user's permission to access their Ethereum account via MetaMask (use `eth_requestAccounts`).
- Estimate the gas required for the transaction.
- Retrieve the current **gas price**.
- Send the transaction and handle any errors (e.g., insufficient funds, user rejection, or network issues).
- Display the transaction receipt if successful.

Please write the function in JavaScript using **Web3.js** and ensure error handling is implemented.

### **Instructions:**
- The function should be written using **Web3.js** and interact with MetaMask.
- If you encounter any assumptions, feel free to make them and mention them in your code comments.
